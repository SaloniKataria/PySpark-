# PySpark-
Academic projects

In this first assignment, I played around a dataset on PySpark 
- Filtering out data
- Applying joins
- Finding active user count and percentage

In the second assignment, I play around RDD on PySpark
- Remove records with "user_verified" is FALSE
- Count the number of tweets for each created date
- Find the sum of "favourite_count" and "retweet_count"
